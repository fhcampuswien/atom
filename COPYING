We grant an exception to the necessity of publishing the sources of your 
modifications for the following 3 cases:

1.) Java-Classes inside the package at.ac.fhcampuswien.atom.shared.domain
    inside the sub-project atom-domain whose only purpose is to represent
    the structure of your domain data and express the domain-specific logic.

2.) Java-Classes inside the package at.ac.fhcampuswien.atom.server.auth with
    the purpose of authenticating your users, or helping other Classes in 
    doing so.

3.) The index.html file, as long as your modifications are only concerned
    with styling the output of the application. You may also split
    it into multiple html, css and js files.

NOTE: This software makes use of a few Widgets from Sencha's GXT library, which
is licensed under GPL. If you plan to do more with your modified version of
this software then just running it on your own webservers (or depending on
interpretation even allowing users outside of your organization access to such
a webserver), you might need to buy a commercial software license from them,
remove/replace the widgets, or open-source even the source-files listed above.
